Gamify Your WordPress Experience with Customizable Wapuu Notifications & Rewards

== Description ==

## WapuuGotchi: Discover and Master WordPress in a Playful Way

Dive into the world of *WapuuGotchi*, the gamification plugin that helps you explore WordPress in a fun and interactive way. At its heart is Wapuu – the unofficial mascot of WordPress. Your personal Wapuu avatar greets you on the dashboard in the lower right corner of your screen and accompanies you on your WordPress journey.

### Customize Your Wapuu

With a continuously growing selection of items, you can customize your Wapuu to suit your style. From clothing to hats, shoes, and other accessories – style your Wapuu just the way you like! However, these items aren’t available right away. To unlock them, you’ll need the plugin’s in-game currency: *Pearls*.

### Earn Pearls and Expand Your Knowledge

Earning Pearls is all about fun! You can collect them by completing exciting missions or by taking on special tasks that support you in your WordPress journey. Not only will you unlock new items, but you'll also expand your WordPress knowledge – step by step, at your own pace. Every discovery becomes a small victory!

### Learn WordPress in a Fun Way

WapuuGotchi also offers a comprehensive tour of your WordPress installation. Let your Wapuu guide you through key areas and discover valuable tips on topics like security, performance, SEO, and more. This way, you’ll gradually become a true WordPress expert – without it ever feeling like work.

### Try It Out Without Installing!

You don’t even need to install the plugin to give it a try! With *Playground*, you can start exploring WapuuGotchi directly in your browser. Go ahead and give it a spin:
