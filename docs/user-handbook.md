## Install plugin
The installation of the plugin is very straightforward. You can download it from the WordPress.org Plugin Directory as zip file or you can install it directly from your WordPress over the default plugin area. For that, you click on *Plugins* in the sidebar navigation and then on *Add New*. You will find Wapuugotchi over the search.

## Dashboard
After the installation, you will see your Wapuu in the Dashboard area on the bottom right corner. Your new friend will show you notifications here.

## Configure your Wapuu
To configure your little pal, the plugin provides you with a boutique full of items which you already own or which can be exchanged for precious pearls. To enter the boutique click on *WapuuGotchi* in the sidebar navigation. You should see the customizer now.

Here in the customizer, you have different types of wearables, which you can use to dress your Wapuu. First of all you have some basic shapes, which differ in form and color. There is a section with things which the Wapuu can hold, like orbs or guitars. Furthermore you can give your little fellow a hat, a haircut or even a crown. Then you have a category with general accessiores like a superhero cape, a baguette or smart-looking glasses. Your Wapuu can also wear a sweater or a t-shirt. And finally you can also dress him with different shoes, which suit to the rest of their outfit.

Some of the items are locked in the beginning and can be unlocked through pearls.

When you click on a locked wearable, a modal will popup and ask you if you want to buy this item. On the top right you can find an information icon. When you hover over that item, you will see more information about the currently shown Wapuu. If you click on *OK*, you confirm your purchase and therefore unlock the item.

A green bar in the customizer shows you how much pearls currently are in your possession.

You can also name your little fellow. Above your Wapuu you can see a text field. Just change the standard Wapuu's name *Wapuu* into something you like more.

### Multiple wearables from one category
Sometimes you have the possibility to use multiple items from a category. This is possible for example with the category which provides accessoires all around the head like hats or fancy haircuts. The order in which you select the items will be used to determine in which order the items should be rendered. The rule is: the first item you select, it the one which is the farthest in the background. It is like you would stack items on top of each other. So if you select a hat and then a haircut, you will end up having the hairs rendered in the foreground.
